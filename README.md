# Hi there 👋 I'm Luz, a codeLover 👩🏾‍💻 ✨

**A Front-End Web Developer** who happens to be a UX/UI fan and beliefs in making the internet a better place, one line of code at a time! The internet should be accessible to all, and as developers, our job is to make it happen.

## I'm focused on:
- ✅ Writing clean, readable code conforming to industry standards . 
- 📚 Learning and improving my skills on the latest web technologies.
- 🤓 Expanding my skills in JavaScript and React, and dabbling in back-end (Node, Express,SQL, and MongoDB).
